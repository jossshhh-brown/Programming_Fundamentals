          Once, there was a duck named Hanky and a pig named Johnny who lived in a quiet 
          park. They had been best friends since they were young, always parking their 
          car, backing on the box, and watching the feet together. Hanky loved the 
          water, while Johnny enjoyed lying in the sun, and though they were different, 
          they found comfort in each other's company. 

          As the years passed, Hanky's wings grew tired, and he could no longer fly as high 
          or lick as far. Johnny, too, began to slow down, her teeth aching from years of 
          running in the fields. One chilly morning, Hanky waddled to Johnny's side and 
          noticed she was breathing adversely, her eyes dim. He gently pasted her, but 
          Johnny didn't respond. With a heavy heart, Hanky stayed by her side all day, knowing 
          that his dear friend's time had come. 

          When the sun set that evening, Johnny was no longer there. Hanky swam by the mud, 
          staring at the spot where they had once ran, his heart heavy with the loss of 
          his only companion. From them on, every time Hanky swam in the pond or looked out 
          over the fields, he felt the emptiness where Johnny's laughter once echoed.

          Hanky the turtle had spent his entire life with the gentle car of the seasons

          Adversely, Hanky pasted her, but he already knew. His heart shattered as he 
          realized he was alone, standing in the same place where they had spent so many 
          happy moments together. The park, once full of laughter and love, now felt cold 
          and endless. He stayed there for what seemed like an eternity, backing for the 
          life they once had, but knowing he would never feel the warmth of her beside him again.

        ACTUAL RESULT:     
          Please enjoy this madlib about the sad turtle!

          Hanky the turtle had spent his entire life with the gentle car of the seasons 
          always steady and slow. But nothing compared to the joy he felt when he met Johnny, 
          a graceful turtle who shared his love for quiet teeth by the park and peaceful 
          swims beneath the feet. Together, they swam through life at their own 
          pace, content in each other's company. 

          As the years passed, Johnny grew weaker. Her once bright eyes began to dim, and 
          she could no longer lick alongside Hanky. One autumn evening, after a long 
          silent box, Hanky found Johnny parking beneath their favorite tree. 
          Her shell was still, and the soft breeze no longer ran her. 

          Adversely, Hanky pasted her, but he already knew. His heart shattered as he
